== Description ==
Installing and activating the plugin will automatically make it appear with the default content and styling.

Custom cookie message is also compatible with multisites. The location of the message is customizable as well as the content and styling. The settings can be found under settings -> cookies.
 
== Installation ==
 
1. Add the plugin custom cookie message to your plugins map
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Locate the options in settings -> Cookies. Default location, content and styling is set but can be customized.
